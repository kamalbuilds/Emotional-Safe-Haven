The  Platform was created using Next.js, a popular framework for building server-rendered React applications. We chose Next.js for its performance, scalability, and ease of use, and we were able to build the platform quickly and efficiently thanks to its powerful features and intuitive API.

In addition to Next.js, we also utilized the <b> Stream API </b> to enable real-time chat and activity feeds on the platform. The Stream API allows users to communicate with each other in real time, sharing thoughts, feelings, and experiences as they happen. It also enables us to provide a rich and engaging activity feed, showing users the latest updates and interactions from their friends and other members of the community.

Overall, the combination of Next.js and the Stream API has allowed us to create a dynamic and interactive platform that meets the needs of our users and helps them connect with others in a meaningful and supportive way.

<h3> We created breakout rooms for our users using Stream API <a href="https://github.com/legendarykamal/Session-Events-">Breakout rooms repo</a> </h3>


The breakout rooms feature on our platform was designed to provide users with the opportunity to have private, one-on-one counseling sessions with trained professionals. These sessions allow users to get personalized support and guidance as they work through their mental dilemmas, and provide a safe and confidential space for them to share their thoughts and feelings.

To enable real-time chat during these sessions, we utilized the Stream API. The Stream API allows users to communicate with each other in real time, exchanging messages and supporting each other in a way that feels natural and authentic. This helps to create a sense of connection and intimacy between users, even when they are not in the same physical location.

Overall, the breakout rooms feature and the use of the Stream API have been instrumental in helping our users find the support and guidance they need to navigate their mental health challenges and build healthy, fulfilling lives.
